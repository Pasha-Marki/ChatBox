## ChatBox
#### A chatroom for the 21st century

A working chatroom using ES2017 Javascript code. A MongoDB backend hashes passwords with bcrypt. It's cryptographically secure and sent to the backend over TLS, but I wouldn't recommend using a password that's used elsewhere.
Messages aren't stored on the database, so only current users can see them, which should make a certain [someone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner) happy.
